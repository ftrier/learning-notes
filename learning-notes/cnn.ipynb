Each filter is slid over the input image, multiplying the filter values with the corresponding pixel values in the image, and summing up the results. This process is repeated for every position of the filter on the image, resulting in a new output feature map.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The main advantage of convolutional layers is their ability to capture local patterns and spatial relationships within the input data. Unlike fully connected layers, which consider all input features equally, convolutional layers exploit the spatial structure of the data by sharing weights across different regions. This property makes convolutional layers particularly effective in tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.\n",

    "    A pooling window slides over the input feature map. At each position, the maximum value within the window is selected and becomes the output value for that region. The pooling window then moves to the next position, until the entire input is covered.\n",
    "    The main purpose of maximum pooling is to downsample the input, reducing its spatial dimensions. This helps in reducing the computational complexity of subsequent layers and extracting the most salient features. By selecting the maximum value within each pooling window, maximum pooling retains the strongest feature activations, enhancing the robustness of the network to small spatial translations or distortions in the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, convolutional and maximum pooling layers are essential building blocks of CNNs that enable the network to learn hierarchical representations of input data. By leveraging local patterns and spatial relationships, these layers extract meaningful features and contribute to the overall performance of the network in various computer vision tasks."

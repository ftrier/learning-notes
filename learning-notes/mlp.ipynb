The most important aspect of the MLP is that these layers are \"hidden\", meaning their values are not observable in the training set. Each node in these layers uses a nonlinear activation function, which allows the MLP to capture complex patterns.\n",

    "In a neural network, each layer consists of multiple neurons, and each neuron is connected to all neurons from the previous layer. The input to a neuron is a weighted sum of the outputs of the neurons from the previous layer. If we consider all neurons in a layer, this operation can be represented as a matrix multiplication. The matrix contains the weights of the connections between the neurons in the current layer and the previous layer. The input data is multiplied by this weight matrix to give the initial output for each neuron in the current layer.\n",

    "Real-world data is often complex and non-linear. Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the network, allowing it to learn and model these complex patterns. Without an activation function, no matter how many layers the network has, it would still behave like a single-layer model because the composition of linear functions is still a linear function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, three types of activation functions are depicted:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identity: This is a linear function where the output is the same as the input. It is used when we want to model a linear relationship. `activation==None`\n",
    "2. ReLU: This function outputs the input directly if it's positive; otherwise, it outputs zero. It's widely used in deep learning models because it helps the model to train faster without sacrificing much accuracy.\n",
    "3. Sigmoid: This function maps the input values into a range between 0 and 1, making it useful for outputting probabilities in binary classification problems.\n",

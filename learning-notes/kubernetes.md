# Kubernetes Cheat Sheet

## Key Concepts

* **Pod** = Container + Layer to abstract the underlying container technology. Each pod has its own ip address
* **Service** provides a static IP address to a pod and acts as load balancer for replicated pods
* All pod have a service. Lifetime of pod and service is not related
* **Ingress** is an "external service" which routes requests to services
* **ConfigMap** stores external configuration of the application, e.g. DB_URL
* **Secret** like ConfigMap, base64 encoded
* **Volume** attaches a physical storage to a pod
* **Deployment** contains a blueprint (template section) for a pod. You can specify the number of replicas of a pod.
* Deployment Spec &rarr; Replicaset &rarr; Pod Spec
* **StatefulSet** is the deployment equivalent for stateful applications (e.g., databases). It ensures that database reads and writes are synchronized to avoid data inconsistencies
* **Worker** node consists of 3 processes
  * Container runtime
  * Kubelet handles the pods
  * Kube Proxy forwards the processes
* **Control Plane** node consists of 4 processes
  * **ApiServer** is a cluster gateway and a gatekeeper to the cluster
  * **Scheduler** determines where to place the pods (Scheduler -> asks Kubelet to schedule)
  * **Controller Manager** detects state changes like pod crashes
  * **Etcd** is a key value store. It is the cluster brain, provides information for the scheduler about the availability of resources

## kubectl

```sh
kubectl create deployment nginx-depl --image=nginx
kubectl edit deployment >deployment<
kubectl logs >pod<
kubectl exec -it >pod< â€” /bin/bash
kubectl apply/delete -f >file<
kubectl get pod -o wide
kubectl get deployments --all-namespaces
kubectl create namespace my-namespace
kubectl rollout restart deployment -n >namespace<
```

## Deployment

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mongodb-deployment
  labels:
    app: mongodb
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mongodb
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mongodb
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: mongodb
          image: mongo
          ports:
            - containerPort: 27017
          env:
            - name: MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: mongodb-secret
                  key: mongo-root-username
            - name: MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: mongodb-secret
                  key: mongo-root-password
--- # separates yaml files
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mongodb-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: mongodb
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 27017       # exposed service port for all pods
      targetPort: 27017 # matches containerPort
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
    name: mongodb-secret
type: Opaque
data:
    mongo-root-username: dXNlcm5hbWU= # echo -n 'username' | base64
    mongo-root-password: cGFzc3dvcmQ= # echo -n 'password' | base64
```

Each config has three parts:

  1. Metadata
  2. Specification
  3. An automatically generated status that compares the desired and actual state (self-healing feature provided by etcd)

The service's selector (`app: nginx`) and the deployment's label (`app: nginx`) define which pods are registered to the service.

## Ingress & External Services

* The service's `targetPort` must match the pod's `containerPort`.
* A LoadBalancer is an external service that opens up `nodePort`.
* A LoadBalancer is only used **without** Ingress, as Ingress has rules to map an external URL to an internal service.
* An Ingress Controller must be installed in the cluster separately.
* This requires a **proxy server** with a public IP address to redirect requests to the Ingress Controller.

* For minikube:

```sh
minikube addons enable ingress
minikube service mongo-express-service
```
*
## Namespaces

* Namespaces are virtual clusters within a cluster.
* Standard Namespaces:
  * `kube-system`: processes kubectl commands
  * `kube-public`: contains public information, `kubectl cluster-info`
  * `kube-node-lease`: tracks node heartbeats
  * `default`

### Grouping

* Logical grouping: Database Namespace, Monitoring Namespace, Nginx Ingress
* Staging and Development Grouping
* Blue/Green Deployment, if they use the same resources:
  * Production Blue (active)
  * Production Green (standby)
* One Namespace per team

### Limitations

* ConfigMaps and Secrets cannot be shared between namespaces.
* Volumes and nodes cannot be namespaced.
* `kubens`/`kubectx` allows selecting the default namespace in the shell.

## Helm Chart

* Package Manager for Kubernetes
* [ArtifactHub](https://artifacthub.io): Can bundle a complete tech stack
* `values.yaml` contains configuration values
* `chart.yaml` contains metadata
* `charts/` folder contains chart dependencies
* `templates/` contains the actual charts

## Storage

### Requirements

1. Storage should not depend on the pod lifecycle.
2. Storage must be accessible from all nodes.
3. Storage must persist even if the cluster crashes.

### Persistent Volumes

* **Persistent Volumes (PV)** are a cluster resource similar to memory; they must exist before pods are created.
* Local storage violates requirements 2 and 3. For **database persistence**, it is best to use remote storage.
* Applications do not directly use PVs but must claim them using **Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)**.
* PVs are not namespaced.
* PVCs are namespaced.
* **Storage Classes** create persistent volumes in the background using a **provisioner**.
* Storage Classes are referenced by PVCs.

## StatefulSet

* Replicas maintain a unique identity for each pod.
  * Pods are named (StatefulSetName)-(ordinal), with the master being 0.
  * Pods have fixed DNS names.
* Pods are created from the same specification but are not interchangeable.
* Only the master pod is allowed to write to the database; other pods can only read.
* Pods need to synchronize data continuously.
* Due to the unique identity, remote storage should be used.

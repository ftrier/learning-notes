    "IoU is calculated as the area of overlap between the two bounding boxes divided by the area of their union. It's a simple and effective metric, but it has a limitation: it doesn't take into account the relative positions of the boxes when they don't overlap. This means that two pairs of boxes can have the same IoU even if one pair is better aligned than the other. IoU ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 means no overlap and 1 means perfect overlap. However, IoU is not differentiable at 0, which makes it unsuitable for use as a loss function in a learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "GIoU extends IoU by also considering the area of the smallest enclosing box that contains both boxes. Specifically, it subtracts from the IoU a term that represents the ratio of the area outside the union but inside the enclosing box to the area of the enclosing box. This makes GIoU a more comprehensive metric that can distinguish between different relative positions of the boxes. GIoU is differentiable and can be used as a loss function.\n",

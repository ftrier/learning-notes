| 1x1 Filter               | A 1x1 filter, also known as a pointwise convolution applies a linear transformation to the input feature map, combining information from different channels or reducing the number of channels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Anchor                   | In object detection, an anchor is a predefined bounding box that is used as a reference for detecting objects in an image. Anchors are typically defined at different scales and aspect ratios to handle objects of various sizes and shapes. During training, the network learns to adjust the anchors to better fit the objects in the image. Anchors play a crucial role in the region proposal network (RPN) of object detection models such as Faster R-CNN and RetinaNet. |
| Anchor-free              | In object detection, anchor-free methods do not rely on predefined anchors to detect objects in an image. Instead, they directly predict the bounding boxes and class probabilities without the need for anchor boxes. Anchor-free methods have gained popularity due to their simplicity and flexibility in handling objects of various sizes and aspect ratios. They have been successfully applied in object detection models such as CenterNet and FCOS.                    |

| Mosaic Data Augmentation | Mosaic data augmentation is a technique used in computer vision tasks, such as object detection, to improve the performance of deep learning models. It involves combining multiple images into a single mosaic image and using it as training data. Mosaic data augmentation helps to increase the diversity and complexity of the training data, leading to better generalization and robustness of the model.                                                                |
| Neck                     | The neck of a neural network refers to an intermediate set of layers or modules that connect the backbone and the head. It is responsible for further refining the features extracted by the backbone before passing them to the head for final processing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| NMS                      | Non-Maximum Suppression is a technique used in object detection to eliminate redundant and overlapping bounding boxes. It selects the most probable bounding box and eliminates any box that has a high overlap (as measured by the Intersection over Union (IoU) metric) with the chosen box.                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Padding                  | Padding is the process of adding extra pixels around the input image or feature map. It is commonly used in convolutional neural networks to preserve spatial dimensions and prevent information loss at the edges of the image. Padding can be done with zeros (zero-padding) or with values from the original image (reflective padding or symmetric padding).                                                                                                                |

| Pooling                  | Pooling is a downsampling operation that reduces the spatial dimensions of the input feature map. It is commonly used to reduce the computational complexity of the network and to extract the most important features. The most common types of pooling are max pooling and average pooling, which take the maximum or average value within a pooling window, respectively.                                                                                                    |

| Region Proposal          | Region proposal is a technique used in object detection to generate potential bounding boxes around objects in an image. It helps to narrow down the search space for the object detector by proposing regions that are likely to contain objects. Region proposal methods, such as Selective Search and EdgeBoxes, use various algorithms to generate these potential regions based on image features and similarity measures.                                                 |

| Skip Connection          | Skip connection, also known as residual connection, is a technique that adds the input of a layer to the output of a subsequent layer. It allows the network to learn residual functions, which can help to alleviate the vanishing gradient problem and improve the flow of gradients during training. Skip connections are commonly used in deep residual networks (ResNet).                                                                                                  |

| Stride                   | Stride refers to the number of pixels the convolutional kernel moves at each step during the convolution operation. A stride of 1 means the kernel moves one pixel at a time, while a stride of 2 means the kernel moves two pixels at a time. Stride affects the output size of the feature map, as well as the amount of computation required.                                                                                                                                |
| Upsampling               | Upsampling is the process of increasing the spatial dimensions of an image or feature map. It is commonly used in tasks such as image super-resolution, semantic segmentation, and generative modeling. Upsampling can be done using techniques such as transposed convolution, nearest-neighbor interpolation, or bilinear interpolation.                                                                                                                                      |

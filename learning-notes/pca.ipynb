    "# Principial Component Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Principial Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical method to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated features into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated features called principal components. The number of principal components is less than or equal to the number of original features. The first principal component accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible, and each succeeding component accounts for as much of the remaining variability as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is commonly used for dimensionality reduction by projecting each data point onto only the first few principal components to obtain lower-dimensional data while preserving as much of the data's variation as possible. The first principal component can equivalently be defined as a direction that maximizes the variance of the projected data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. PCA identifies orthogonal axes (principal components) in the original feature space.\n",
    "2. These axes are ordered by the amount of variance they explain.\n",
    "3. By projecting the data onto these axes, we reduce the dimensionality while preserving the most important information.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand what we are doing and why we are doing it, we need a little excursion in the field of statistics\n"

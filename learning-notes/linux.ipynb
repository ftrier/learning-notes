    "The home directory is a personal directory assigned to each user on the system. It serves as the default working directory when a user logs in and is where the user's personal files, configurations, and directories are stored. The `~` is a shorthand for theÂ home directory. It simplifies navigation.\n",

Next, we used the echo command to output text. A plain `echo \"Hello\"` would just print Hello to the standard outoutput `stdout`, which is typically the terminal. The `>` operator redirects the output to a file instead of displaying it to the terminal. The `>>` appends to a file instead of overwriting. If a program prints a lot of debug information for example to stdout, you can use `>`/`>>` operator to aggregate the logs and write them into a file."

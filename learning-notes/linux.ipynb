    "This notebook serves as starting point for learning linux and the bash terminal. I highly recommend, that you run it interactively via the mybinder.org link in the top. This will allow you to execute the commands yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "Usually developers, system administrators, devop engineers, etc. interact with the the linux operating system via a textual interface, called the shell. The most common type of shell is called `bash`. For now, the differences between these is not so important, but during troubleshooting it might help to know which shell you are using.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linux comes with lots of preinstalled programs which make working with the shell very easy. We will look at some of them and how to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is for learning purpose only. You will never interact with the shell using such a notebook. The `%%bash` as well as the exclamation mark (`!`) in the lines is only for the notebook. The `%%bash` transforms the whole cell into a bash terminal while the `!` runs only a single command via the shell."

    "Linux is a directory/file-based operating system.\n",
    "In Linux, everything is treated as a file, including hardware devices, processes, and system configurations. The file system is organized in a hierarchical directory structure, with the root directory `/` at the top. All files and directories are accessed relative to this root directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The home directory is a personal directory assigned to each user on the system. It serves as the default working directory when a user logs in and is where the user's personal files, configurations, and directories are stored. The `~` is a shorthand for theÂ home directory. It simplifies navigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, when you open up a terminal, your session will start in the `~` folder. This is not always the case, as for the notebook here for example. The notebook and the shell open up in the folder from where they are launched. Let us look at that first."
